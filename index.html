          <p>My journey starts from a small village named Machhimpur. I was born in this village and then at the age of 4, I migrated to a nearby town called Gouripur. I have spent almost all my life in gouripur. Later in my life, I had to go to Dhaka to parsue my college and university education. I love travelling, fishing and playing football. Doing scientific experiment is one of my favourite hobbies. I really like to playing with chemicals and try to make some handicrafts.

            I had enjoyed an adventurous journey in terms of my schooling. At the early stage of my life, I admitted in a pre-primary school named <strong>"Ikra kindergarten"</strong> which was in Narandia. Then I went to Gouripur and joined a renowned school called <strong>"Ananda Multimedia School"</strong>; however, I did not able to continue for long time. My parents always want me to sit on government scholarship exam. So, I left <strong>"AMS"</strong> and started going <strong>"Gouripur Government Primary school"</strong>. Interesting fact is, I left "GGPS" within 4 months since my parents went back to my village Machhimpur. In my village, I got admitted into <strong>"Machhimpur Government Primary school"</strong> and successfully passed PSC exam with "government scholarship". After that I admitted into <strong>"Machhimpur R R Instituion"</strong>. Again, I came back to Gouripur and joined <strong>"Gouripur S A High School"</strong>. I passed my SSC from "GSAHS" and went to Dhaka to attend college. My college was <strong>"Dhaka City College"</strong>. Finally, completing my college, I got admitted to <strong>"Daffodil International University"</strong> and achieved my <strong>"B.Sc"</strong> degree in the field of <strong>"Computer Science"</strong>. Now, I am plannig to go abroad for my <strong>"M.Sc"</strong>.
